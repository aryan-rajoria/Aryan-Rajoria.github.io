                Hello! I’m a final year Computer Science major at Bennett
                University. During my coursework, I have developed great
                interest in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial
                Intelligence. Using my strong background in software development
                and experience of working on a wide variety of projects, I would
                like to pursue a career in ML research and a good internship
                would consolidate my future career choice. I’m personally
                interested in the field of meta learning and its use to improve
                the performance of machine learning algorithms.
            </p>
